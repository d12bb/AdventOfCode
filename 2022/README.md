**My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)**

One day, one programming language.. (until I grow tired of it):

1. Rust. I love this language!
2. Go. if err != nil and `switch`eroo..
3. Python. I use tabs, btw.
4. C. Took me a while, glad I got this over and done with.
5. Ruby. Long time since I last used this one.
6. Clojure. If only it wasn't built on Java..
7. Lua. No off-by-one errors today.
