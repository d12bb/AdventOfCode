**My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)**

One day, one programming language.. (until I grow tired of it):

1. Rust. I love this language!
2. Go. if err != nil and `switch`eroo..
3. Python. I use tabs, btw.
4. C. Took me a while, glad I got this over and done with.
5. Ruby. Long time since I last used this one.
6. Clojure. If only it wasn't built on Java..
7. Lua. No off-by-one errors today.
8. VimScript. Thank goodness there's Neovim with Fennel nowadays.
9. Zig. Why Zig when there's Rust?
10. Fish. Really a more friendly shell.
11. Raku (Perl 6). `grammar` looks nice.
12. Swift. Kinda torn on this one.
13. Haskell. GHC warns when using tabs, wtf?
14. Nim. Compiled and statically-typed Python: Nice. Not allowing tabs for indention: Not nice.
15. Elixir (and Rust). Don't know why part 2 run for hours in Elixir, when the same algorithm finishes within 650ms in Rust..
16. Crystal. Basically Ruby, compiled.
17. Dart. Feels like C with modern types.
18. Racket. Try the rainbow, use a rainbow (plugin).
20. D. A systems programming language with GC by default.
21. Pascal. Oh these flashback, learning pragramming with Delphi back then..
